# transformer

A Transformer implementation in Keras' Imperative (Subclassing) API.

The goal is to provide independent implementations of individual blocks for experimentation, especially encoder.

Currently exports `Transformer(Model)`, `Encoder(Model)`, `Decoder(Model)`, `MultiHeadAttention(Model)` and `Attention(Layer)`.
